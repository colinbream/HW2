<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am currently a senior at the University of Iowa majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems in the Tippie College of Business. I am from Solon, Iowa which is located fifteen miles north of Iowa City.</P>

<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>I have a wide variety of interests, but I really enjoy doing anything outdoors. Activities that I especially enjoy doing include:  </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Golfing</li>
		<li>Fishing</li>
		<li>Camping</li>
		<li> Mountain Biking</li>
		<li>Skiing</li>
	</ul>
	
 <p>I grew up just outside of Solon, Iowa near Lake McBride so being outdoors was a huge part of my childhood. There is a golf course, lake, and campground all within a mile of my home, which is a big reason why I picked up many of these hobbies. Another reason why I enjoy doing these activities is because I am able to do them with my family. In the past I have taken golfing trips down to the Ozarks in Missouri with my parents. Also, my dad and I take fishing and camping trips on a regular basis. We like to go to all kinds of lakes around Iowa. Some of our favorite places to go include: Lake Rathban, Lake Suegema, and Twelve Mile Lake. We have also taken trips outside of the state, usually up to Minnesota. In recent years, one of our favorites lakes to visit in Minnesota is Leech Lake.</p>

<p>Another one of my main interests is sports. Some of my favorite teams include: the Iowa Hawkeyes, the Denver Broncos, and the Colorado Rockies. Growing up fifteen miles away from Iowa City I was born and raised an Iowa Hawkeye fan. I have spent many Saturday afternoons cheering on the Hawkeyes at Kinnick stadium. This season was extra special as I was able to go to Indianapolis to watch the Hawks play in the B1G Championship. I have also been to many Colorado Rockies games during the summer. I have a brother that lives in Denver so we usually go to a game when we are out there to visit him. I hope to attend a Broncos game at Mile High stadium in Denver in the near future.    </p>

<p>Traveling has always been a big part of my life. I have taken many trips all across the United States with family and friends. One of my favorite places to visit is Colorado. My family and I have been going out there for ski trips since I was six or seven years old. We regularly go to Keystone ski resort in Dillon, Colorado during spring break or even sometimes during the winter months. My most recent trip was to New York City over winter break with my mom. We went to some plays and did a lot of sight-seeing. It was a great place to visit and was an awesome experince. </p>

<h3>Career Aspirations</h3>
<p>After graduation from the University of Iowa I hope to start a career in the healthcare industry. For quite some time now I have wanted to work in healthcare because I feel like it would be very meaningful work and something that I would enjoy. Ideally, I would like to start a career working with health management information systems. I have always been interested in health and technology, and combining the two in a career would be my dream job. </p>
